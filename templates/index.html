            <h1 id="stones">Types of Kidney Stones</h1>
            <p>There are several types of kidney stones, each formed from different substances found in the urine. The most common types of kidney stones include:</p>
            
            <h2>1. Calcium Stones</h2>
        <p>These are the most common type of kidney stones and are usually composed of calcium oxalate. Oxalate is a naturally occurring substance found in foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and chocolate. High levels of oxalate in the urine can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate stones.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Struvite Stones</h2>
        <p>Also known as infection stones, struvite stones are often caused by urinary tract infections (UTIs). These stones can grow quickly and become quite large, often leading to blockages in the urinary tract.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Uric Acid Stones</h2>
        <p>Uric acid stones form when there is an excess of uric acid in the urine. This can occur due to a diet high in purines, which are found in certain foods like red meat, organ meats, and seafood. Conditions like gout and certain genetic factors can also increase the risk of uric acid stone formation.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Cystine Stones</h2>
        <p>Cystine stones are rare and are caused by a hereditary disorder called cystinuria. People with cystinuria have high levels of the amino acid cystine in their urine, which can form crystals and lead to the formation of stones.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Other Stones</h2>
        <p>Less common types of kidney stones include those made of other substances such as ammonium acid urate and xanthine.</p>
        
        <p>It's essential to identify the type of kidney stone a person has because treatment and prevention strategies may vary depending on the stone's composition. A healthcare provider can perform tests to determine the specific type of kidney stone and develop an appropriate treatment plan.</p>
